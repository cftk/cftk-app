# CFTK App - v1.0
### Contributors: Gabriel Timotei (gabtimotei)
### Description: Official app for the Carolina For The Kids organization

## NOTES:
 - This code is a LOT cleaner than mobile bidding

## TODO:
 - Transition the scavenger hunt screen into a general incentives screen (must be paired with another website to keep track of incentives)
 - Transition the app into the 2019 UNCDM
 - Fix the Teams portion of the Home screen so that it can display "No Team" if dancer has not been sorted

## QUIRKS:
 - Every time you want to change something in the app and upload it to the app stores, you have to change the `version` number in `app.json`. Be mindful of version naming conventions, as bug fixes change the rightmost number, small updates change the middle number, and major changes change the rightmost number.

## DO NOT TOUCH:
 - /_tests_
 - _/_universe
 - /help
 - .babelrc
 - .watchmanconfig
